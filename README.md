# 📝 Python CLI Note Reminder App

A **simple, beginner-friendly CLI-based app** built in Python that lets users:
- Register
- Log in
- Create, view, and delete notes/reminders
- Reset forgotten passwords

🧠 The project is modularized — logic is cleanly separated into a reusable module (`account_module.py`) and a main runner (`main.py`).
